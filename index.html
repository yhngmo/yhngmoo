            <p>After graduating high school and not really knowing which path to take, i decided to just drop out of college. I decided to learn on my own and develop a skill that was going to helo me get a some source of income.
                 I started off by learning different skill sets. I started by learning about the stock market and economy and that i can make money investing as little as 100 dollars. after a few investments i started notcing that i 
                 can earn investing but that was not the only thing i wanted to do. plus i needed a source of income so i can invest and bring more profit. so i endeed up gettinga job but i didn't much to invest after paying bills.
                 So i decided to join Generation USA so they can teach me how to become a jr. Full Stack Java Developer. And as of now im doing that full time and i can't wait to graduate and get a better job so i can start investing and
                 live my dream!
